Editors may make use of the e-mail template below in recruiting reviewers.

Dear [REVIEWER]

Hi, this is [EDITOR]. [FRIENDLY BANTER]. I'm writing to ask if you would be willing to review a package for rOpenSci. As you probably know, rOpenSci conducts peer review of R packages contributed to our collection in a manner similar to journals.

The package, [PACKAGE] by [AUTHOR(S)], does [FUNCTION]. You can find it on GitHub here: [REPO LINK]. We conduct our open review process via GitHub as well, here: [ONBOARDING ISSUE]

If you accept, note that we ask reviewers to complete reviews in three weeks. (We’ve found it takes a similar amount of time to review a package as an academic paper.)

Our [reviewers guide] details what we look for in a package review, and includes links to example reviews. Our standards are detailed in our [packaging guide], and we provide reviewer [template] for you to use. Please make sure you do not have a [conflict of interest](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#coi) preventing you from reviewing this package. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to ask me or post to the [rOpenSci forum].

{IF APPLICABLE: The authors have also chosen to jointly submit their package to the Journal of Open Source Software, so this package includes a short `paper.md` manuscript describing the software that we ask you include in your review.}

Are you able to review? If you can not, suggestions for alternate reviewers are always helpful. If I don't hear from you within a week, I will assume you are unable to
review at this time.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[EDITOR]

# Approval comment template {#approvaltemplate}

```

Approved! Thanks <author(s) GitHub username(s)> for submitting and <reviewers' GithHub usernames> for your reviews! <optional: smiling cat emoji à la Scott>

To-dos:
- [ ] Transfer the repo to rOpenSci's "ropensci" GitHub organization under "Settings" in your repo.  I have invited you to a team that should allow you to do so.  You'll be made admin once you do.
- [ ] Add the rOpenSci footer to the bottom of your README
"```
[![ropensci_footer](https://ropensci.org/public_images/ropensci_footer.png)](https://ropensci.org)```"
- [ ] Fix any links in badges for CI and coverage to point to the ropensci URL. We no longer transfer Appveyor projects to ropensci Appveyor account so after transfer of your repo to rOpenSci's "ropensci" GitHub organization the badge should be `[![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ropensci/pkgname?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/individualaccount/pkgname)`.
- [ ] We're starting to roll out software metadata files to all ropensci packages via the Codemeta initiative, see https://github.com/ropensci/codemetar/#codemetar for how to include it in your package, after installing the package - should be easy as running codemetar::write_codemeta() in the root of your package.
<IF JOSS>
- [ ] Activate Zenodo watching the repo
- [ ] Tag and create a release so as to create a Zenodo version and DOI
- [ ] Submit to JOSS using the Zenodo DOI.  We will tag it for expedited review.
<IF JOSS/>

Should you want to awknowledge your reviewers in your package DESCRIPTION, you can do so by making them `"rev"`-type contributors in the `Authors@R` field (with their consent).  More info on this [here](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/building.html#authorship).

Welcome aboard! We'd also love a blog post about your package, either a short-form intro to it (https://ropensci.org/tech-notes/) or long-form post with more narrative about its development. (https://ropensci.org/blog/). If you are interested, @stefaniebutland will be in touch about content and timing.

We've started putting together a gitbook with our best practice and tips, [this chapter](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/collaboration.html) starts the 3d section that's about guidance for after onboarding. Please tell us what could be improved, the corresponding repo is [here](https://github.com/ropensci/dev_guide).
