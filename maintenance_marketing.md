# Marketing your package {#marketing}

<div class="summaryblock">
<p>We will help you promoting your package but here are some more things to keep in mind.</p>
</div>

* If you hear of an use case of your package, please post the link to our [discussion forum in the Use Cases category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases) and tag Scott Chamberlain (`@sckott`) for inclusion in the [rOpenSci biweekly newsletter](https://news.ropensci.org/) (or tag Scott on Slack). We also recommend you to add a link to the use case in a "use cases in the wild" section of your README.

* When you release a new version of your package or release it to CRAN for the first time, 

    * Make a pull request to [R Weekly](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org) with a line about the release under the "New Releases" section (or "New Packages" for the first GitHub/CRAN release).
    
    * Tweet about it using the "#rstats" hashtag and tag rOpenSci! Example.

    * Consider submitting a technote about the release to [rOpenSci technotes blog](https://ropensci.org/technotes/). Contact Stefanie Butland, rOpenSci community manager, (e.g. via Slack or stefanie@ropensci.org ). The guidelines about contributing a blog post can be found [here](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2#contributing-a-blog-post)).
    
    * Submit your package to lists of packages such as [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/), and [rOpenSci non-CRAN Task Views](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aropensci+%22task+view%22&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults).
    
* If you choose to market your package by giving a talk about it at a meetup or conference (excellent idea!)
